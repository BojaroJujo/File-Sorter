# File Sorter
Uses PowerShell to sort files within a folder into separate subfolders, dependent on their file extension. (i.e. .mp3s go into a music folder)<br>
Provide the program a directory, and it will create separate folders for images, videos and music within the directory, and move any related files within the directory into the corresponding subdirectories.
